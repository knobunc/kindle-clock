            'Miss Penny looked at her watch. "Good heavens!" she said, "it\'s <<nearly half-past three|10>>. I must fly. Don\'t forget about the funeral service," she added, as she put on her coat. "The tapers, the black coffin, in the middle of the aisle, the nuns in their white-winged coifs, the gloomy chanting, and the poor cowering creature without any teeth, her face all caved in like an old woman\'s, wondering whether she wasn\'t really and in fact dead - wondering whether she wasn\'t already in hell. Good-bye."',
