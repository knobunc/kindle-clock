"~ 19:00"|"about 7 p.m."|"The robbery with which Jim Timson was charged was an exceedingly simple one. At about 7 p.m. one Friday evening, the date being 16 September, the two elderly Brixton butchers, Mr Cadwallader and Mr Lewis Stein, closed their shop in Bombay Road and walked with their week's takings round the corner to a narrow alley-way known as Green's Passage, where their grey Austin van was parked. When they got to the van they found that the front tyres had been deflated. They stooped to inspect the wheels and, as they did so they were attacked by a number of boys, some armed with knives and one flourishing a cricket stump. Luckily, neither of the butchers was hurt, but the attache case containing their money was snatched."|"Rumpole of the Bailey"|"John Mortimer"

Now,' he was opening a brown envelope, 'I only get invitations to insure my life. It's a little late for that.' Albert told me that the robbery was not before 11.30 before Mr Justice Everglade in Number i Court. He also told me who was prosecuting, none other than the tall, elegant figure with the silk handkerchief and gold wristwatch, leaning against the mantelpiece and negligently reading a large cheque from the Director of Public Prosecutions, Guthrie Featherstone, M.P. He removed the silk handkerchief, dabbed the end of his nose and his small moustache and asked in that voice which comes over so charmingly, saying nothing much about any important topic of the day in 'World at One', 'Agin me Rumpole? Are you agin me?' He covered a slight yawn with the handkerchief before returning it to his breast pocket. 'Just come from an all-night sitting down at the House. I don't suppose your robbery'll be much of a worry.' ' Only, possibly, to young Jim Timson,' I told him, and then gave Albert his orders for the day. 'Mrs Rumpole's gone down to see her father in Horsham.' 'How is Wystan? No better, is he?' Uncle Tom sounded as gently pleased as all old men do when they hear news of illness in others."|"Rumpole of the Bailey"|"John Mortimer"

Hilda had told Nick that his grandpa had sent his love and expected a letter, and also dropped me the encouraging news that old C.H. Wystan was retiring and quite appreciated that I was the senior man. Nick asked me if I was really going to be Head of Chambers, seeming to look at me with a new respect, and we drank a glass of claret to the future, whatever it might be. Then Nick asked me if I really thought Peanuts Molloy was lying."|"Rumpole of the Bailey"|"John Mortimer"

'Then if it's where the Bar put up, I shall avoid it. I'm staying with old mates, from my days in the R.A.F. They run a stately pleasure-dome known as the Crooked Billet.' 'The little pub place out on the bay?' I noticed Friendly smiled when he spoke of the Dogherty's delight, a place, I had no doubt, of a high reputation. The taxi had stopped now, and I was wrestling with the door. When I had it open, I was in a high and holiday mood."|"Rumpole of the Bailey"|"John Mortimer"

As I recited to her Hilda took advantage of the open mouth to slide in the spoonful of linctus. I didn't relish the taste of artificially sweetened hair oil. All the same little Johnny Keats, Lord Byron's piss-a-bed poet, had put the matter rather well. Then more than ever, seemed it rich to get away from it all. No more judges. No more bowing and saying 'If your Lordship pleases.' No more hopelessly challenging the verbals. No more listening to endless turgid speeches from my learned friends for the prosecution. 'To cease upon the midnight. With no pain.' From my position between two worlds I heard the telephone beside the bed ringing distantly.

"~ 02:00"|"about two in the morning"|"That evening I was re-reading my brief in the living-room at Froxbury Court with a still slightly feverish eye. I came again to something in Charlie Wheeler's proof of evidence that had always puzzled me, a conversation he had had with D. I. Dicker-son at about two in the morning in a police cell. Charlie's recollection of the event hadn't been particularly clear but it seemed there had been an offer of bail in exchange for a confession and it had ended in some sort of temporary agreement, because the officer had shaken Charlie's hand before leaving him for the rest of the night. I read the short, unilluminating paragraph through several times before something which could hardly be called an idea, more a vague hint of the possibility of some future thought, floated into my mind. I lit a small cigar, which considerably improved the quality of my cough, and gazed at the rising smoke."|"Rumpole of the Bailey"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 09:30"|9.30|"'I've been round twenty pubs,' he told me. 'No joy. But I've got a number to phone. Place where his sister works.' He looked at his watch.' They won't be open till 9.30.' 'Oh, find him, Philbeam, old darling. We may be all set for the unmasking of ""Dirty "" Dickerson.' I sent Philbeam about his business and went over to the Palais de Justice. The dear old place was as I liked it best, quiet and peaceful with only a few tired cleaning ladies and sleepy attendants to greet me. I got changed into my working clobber, wig, gown and so on, at my leisure and went down to the lower ground floor. I had rung Bernard the night before and asked him to meet me for an early conference with the client. But when I got to the old battered Newgate door, which divides the safe sheep from the imperilled goats, I found only the secretary Joyce, looking harassed and with her arms full of files."|"Rumpole of the Bailey"|"John Mortimer"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"about two o'clock"|"'No! Only me collar.' ' Show me, how he shook hands with you. You be the Detective Inspector.' Charlie took my hand, but only for a moment.' It was all over in a second. And I never made no statement. It ain't in me character.' 'How did Dickerson look when he shook hands with you? Did he look pleased, triumphant?' ' I couldn't hardly see him.' 'What?' ' It was in my cell. In the Dartford Nick. I don't know… about two o'clock of a morning. I was half asleep… well, he was in the dark, like. He did seem that little bit nervous.' 'Nervous?' ' Well. You know what you expect from a man of his build. Good firm grip. Well, that hand of his felt a bit clammy and soft.' I stood up, the vague thought had not only become an idea but a plan of attack, a series of questions for cross-examination."|"Rumpole of the Bailey"|"John Mortimer"
02:00|"two o'clock in the morning"|"'We have no idea when the fingerprints got on the gelignite.' 'Haven't we?' 'Or where. Is it just possible, Detective Inspector, that Charlie Wheeler only touched the gelignite in the Dartford Police Station?' There was another, minute pause before he answered.' I don't know what you mean.' It was time to tell the jury exactly what I meant, and bring Charlie's defence out into the open. ' In that dark cell, at two o'clock in the morning, do you think you had the gelignite, this little piece of gelignite, concealed in your palm when you held your hand out to him. And shook hands. As you had never shaken hands with any prisoner in your life before? Is that the only explanation of how Charlie Wheeler's fingerprints got on to Exhibit i?' I hadn't expected Dickerson to crumble and apologize, but I had hoped for a bluster, an outraged denial which might have said more than he intended. But he was too experienced a witness for that; he only smiled tolerantly and said, 'If that's what Wheeler told you. I mean if… Then it's a load of nonsense. You know that, Mr Rumpole.' ' Is it all lies. Detective Inspector?' Bullingham asked."|"Rumpole of the Bailey"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 02:10"|"ten past two"|"'All lies, my Lord.' The judge wrote that last answer down, in case he forgot it. Then he gave the jury one of his least lovable grins. 'It's always painful to watch an officer of this sort of length of service under attack, members of the jury. I expect we'd all be glad of a break. Back at ten past two, Air Erskine-Brown.' So, ignoring Rumpole, he bundled himself out of Court."|"Rumpole of the Bailey"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 06:30"|6.30|"I ignored this, no judge alive was going to spoil the climax of my speech, and I could tell that the jury were flattered, not to say delighted, to hear me tell them, ' Of course you are the only judges of fact in this case. But if you find Peter Delgardo guilty, then Mr X will smile, and order up champagne. Because, wherever he is, he will know… he's safe at last!' Frank Prestcold summed up, as I knew he would, dead against Petey. He called the prosecution evidence 'overwhelming' and the jury listened politely. They went out just after lunch, and were still out at 6.30 when I telephoned Hilda and told her that I'd change in Chambers, and meet her at the Savoy, and I wanted it clearly understood that I wasn't dancing. I was just saying this when the usher came out and told me that the jury were back with a verdict."|"Rumpole of the Bailey"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o'clock"|"'Apparently it was on the nine o'clock news. They've just arrested Leslie Delgardo. Charged him with the murder of Tosher MacBride. I'll want a con with you in the morning.' I was left out of this conversation, but I didn't mind. Music started again, playing a tune which I found vaguely familiar. Nooks was muttering on; it seemed that the police now knew Tosher worked for Leslie, and that some member of the rival Watson family may have spotted him at the scene of the crime. An extraordinary sensation overcame me, something I hadn't felt for a long time, which could only be described as happiness."|"Rumpole of the Bailey"|"John Mortimer"
